# Flip A Coin (React)

This is a minimal React project that contains the `Coin` component and styles.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server

```bash
npm start
```

Notes

- This project uses `react-scripts` (Create React App) and `sass` to compile `Coin.sass`.
- If you prefer Vite or Next.js scaffolding, tell me and I can convert it.
